- 👋 Hi, I’m @leandrogbreve
- 👀 I’m interested in javascript, react native, python, php, AI, machine learning, deep learning, 
  and any other technology that is trend. I've got good programming logic as I'm usually able to understand codes and make changes in existing programs, 
  but I feel I'm not ready to start a program from zero. Also, I'm very curious and willing to learn new stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that could give me more confidence to say 'I can code'.
